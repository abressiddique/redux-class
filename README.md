# Redux Overview

**Redux** is a state management library for JavaScript applications that helps manage and maintain the application's state in a predictable manner. It provides a centralized store to keep track of the application's state, making it easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

## Key Concepts

### State

- **State** refers to the data that represents the current condition of your application. In Redux, this data is stored in a single object called the **store**.

### Actions

- **Actions** are plain JavaScript objects that describe what you want to do with the state. They serve as commands or requests to modify the state.

### Reducers

- **Reducers** are pure functions that take the current state and an action as input and return a new state. They are responsible for updating the state based on the action provided.

### Store

- The **store** is the central object in Redux that holds the application's state. It dispatches actions and calls reducers to update the state accordingly.

## How Redux Works

Redux helps manage the state of an application by:

1. Storing the state in a centralized store.
2. Dispatching actions to signal state changes.
3. Using reducers to update the state based on the actions.
4. Accessing the updated state using hooks like `useSelector`.

### Dispatch

- **Dispatch** is a function used to send actions to the Redux store. When you dispatch an action, it triggers the appropriate reducer to update the state.

### useSelector

- **useSelector** is a React hook provided by `react-redux` that allows you to access the current state of a Redux store within a functional component. It takes a selector function as an argument, which defines how to extract the desired part of the state.

## Summary

In simple terms, Redux helps manage the state of an application by storing it centrally. You can dispatch actions to modify the state, and reducers will handle the updates. The updated state can then be accessed using the `useSelector` hook.

## Installation

To get started with Redux, you'll need to install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install redux react-redux
